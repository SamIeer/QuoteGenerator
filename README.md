he project is a small AI Quote Generator API, which serves random motivational quotes via a simple REST endpoint.

💡 Here’s what I learned hands-on:

How to launch and configure an AWS EC2 instance (Ubuntu 22.04)

How to connect securely using SSH & key pairs

How to install dependencies, run FastAPI on the server, and make it accessible publicly

Basics of networking & security groups in AWS (allowing HTTP/SSH access)

Even though this was a simple setup — no Docker or CI/CD yet — it helped me clearly understand how apps actually run in the cloud
